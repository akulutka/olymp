### There you can see >20 different algorithms I've been researching for last three years

## Level A
- Heavy-Light tree decomposition *\*sigh\**

## Level B
- Scanline X Segment tree
- Segment tree with massive operations: RSQ
- LCA

## Level C
- Segment tree: RMQ
- Segment tree: RSQ
- DSU
- Fenwick's tree
- Fenwick's 3D tree
- Heap
- Manacher's algorithm
- Z-function
- ÐŸ-function
- Sparse table
- Ternary search
- Treap
- Dijktstra's algorithm
- Graph bridges detection
- Graph articulation points detection
- Square root decomposition
- Polynomial hash for strings
- Bracket sequence 
- **BIG** geometry listing, contains 20 different functions and 4 structures

## Level D
- DFS
- Topological graph sort
- GCD/LCM
- Binary search
- Quick sort
- Merge sort
